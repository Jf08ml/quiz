# Back Code Challenge
## Description

This project is an interactive quiz system designed to test knowledge through true or false questions. During the quiz, users answer a series of questions. If the answer is correct, they advance; otherwise, they are shown the correct answer with its justification. At the end of the quiz, users can view their score and save their answers.

The system also includes a complete CRUD to manage the questions, allowing to add, edit, delete and query questions. In addition, it has a user authentication system and a role validator, ensuring that certain functionalities are accessible only to users with the appropriate permissions.
